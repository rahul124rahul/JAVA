// Write a python program to encrupt the grade by adding 8 to it . Decrept the grade to show the correct grade 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p_7{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

        char a = 'C';
        char e = (char)(a+8);
        
        // The grade is encrupted 
        
        System.out.println("Firstly the grade is encrupted  ");
        System.out.println("Dummy Grade is : "+e);
        
        // then the code is decrepted 

        System.out.println("Then the Grade is Decrepted ");
        System.out.println("Original Grade is : "+ (char)(e-8));        

    }

Output :

Firstly the grade is encrupted  
Dummy Grade is : K
Then the Grade is Decrepted 
Original Grade is : C
