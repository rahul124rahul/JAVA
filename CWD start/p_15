// 13 ) JAVA Tutorial - Introduction to the string

    // - String is Sequence of the characters 
    // - The Srting is instantiated as follows :
    //  String name ;
    //  name = new String ("Rahul");
    
    // - String is the class but it can be used like  a data type :
    //   - Strings are immutable and cannot be changed .
    //   - String name = "Rahul";

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p_9 {
    public static void main(String arg[]){

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String s = new String("Rahul");
        System.out.println(s);
        String n = "Sonu";
        System.out.println(n);

        // Different ways to print in JAVA are as follows :
        System.out.println("Rahul is a Good Boy !!");       // Automatically new line is addded to the next line 
        System.out.print("Sonu is a Brave boy.");       // No new line is added to next line 
        System.out.println();           // This is used to add new line
        
        System.out.printf("Rahul is %d years old. His height it %d cm.His weight is %.3fkg.",21,165,70.434246757687);        // (1)IMP
        System.out.println();
        System.out.format("Rahul is %d years old. His height it %d cm.His weight is %7.3fkg.",21,165,70.445665577689899);        // (2)IMP
            // Both 1 & 2 are works in the same way. We can use any of these.
        System.out.println();


        System.out.print("Enter your full name : ");
        // String st = sc.next();   // It will take only one word as input and return single word at the time of accessing
        String st = sc.nextLine();      // This will read all the line and also the white spaces in between the words
        System.out.println("Your name is : "+st);


    }
}


Output :
